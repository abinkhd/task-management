`Task Manager`

Project Description
Task Manager is a simple task management application built with React. It allows users to log in, manage their tasks, and store their tasks persistently in the browserâ€™s localStorage. Each user has their own task list, and tasks are stored specific to the logged-in user. The application supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing tasks.

Features
Login System: Secure login for users to access their task list.
Task Management: Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are stored in localStorage and are tied to the logged-in user.
User-specific Task Lists: Each user has their own task list.
Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
JavaScript: The core programming language for the application logic.
Context API: For state management across the app.
HTML: For structure and content of the web pages.
CSS: For styling and layout of the app.
MUI: UI Component Library
